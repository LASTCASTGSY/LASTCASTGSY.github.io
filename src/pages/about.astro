      <h1>Siyu Gan <span style="color: var(--color-text-muted); font-weight: 400;">(Thrain)</span></h1>

      <p>
        I'm a double-major in Mathematics (Data Science option) and Physics at the University of Houston.
        My work sits at the intersection of probabilistic machine learning and physical science — specifically,
        I build score-based diffusion models for time-series imputation and forecasting.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main project is <strong>WaveCast2</strong>, a codebase for probabilistic ocean wave forecasting
        using CSDI-style conditional diffusion. The system handles extreme missingness (~80%) in buoy
        observations, produces calibrated uncertainty estimates, and recently gained multimodal conditioning
        via cross-attention fusion with ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm drawn to problems where the underlying dynamics are stochastic and the observations are incomplete —
        which describes most of the physical world. My mathematical interests include random matrices,
        high-dimensional probability, and the geometry of score functions in high-dimensional spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently looking for <strong>ML internship</strong> roles where I can work on generative models,
        time-series problems, or AI-for-science applications. I care about clean code, honest evaluation, and
        building things that work on real data.
